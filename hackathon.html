                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    For the 2025 Columbia Engineering Hackathon, I worked with a team of 4 other students to create a self stabilizing gimble for camera and film applications.

                <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                <p>
                 Because I was the only one on the team with experience in hardware, I took on the role of designing and building the circuitry for the project. This involved using a combination of off the shelf components, such as an IMU and a motor driver, and an arduino nano.
                The first challenge I faced was integrating the IMU with the arduino. I had to research how to read data from the IMU, and how to use that data to control the motors. I also had to design a circuit that would allow me to power the motors and the arduino, while also keeping everything compact and lightweight.
                In the end, we were able to create a working prototype of this gimble, and we were able to demonstrate it at the hackathon. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about working with hardware in a team setting.
